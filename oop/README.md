Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 
- Class
- Objects
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulationсы
- Inheritance
- Data Abstraction

### Python class:  

Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

### An object consists of :

State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

### Self

The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. 
Self is always pointing to Current Object.
